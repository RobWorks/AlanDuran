This repository contains two projects: monocular_road_detection and monocular_visual_odometry. Both are OpenCV 4.0 based implementations of monocular vision algorithms.

Each project contains:
- Source files
- Some examples of the outputs generated by the algorithms and the inputs used for each case
- Documentation (in spanish for the time being) giving more details about how they were done.
