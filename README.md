This repository contains two projects: monocular_road_detection and monocular_visual_odometry. Both of them are OpenCV 4.0 based implementations of monocular vision algorithms.

Each project contains its source files, some examples of inputs used and the outputs generated and documentation (in spanish for the time being) giving more details about how they were done.
